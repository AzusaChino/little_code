## 115. Distinct Subsequences

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return _the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`_.

A string's **subsequence** is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions. (i.e., `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

It is guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:**
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
`**rabb**b**it**`
`**ra**b**bbit**`
`**rab**b**bit**`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:**
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
`**ba**b**g**bag`
`**ba**bgba**g**`
`**b**abgb**ag**`
`ba**b**gb**ag**`
`babg**bag**`

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000`
- `s` and `t` consist of English letters.

```java
public int numDistinct(String s, String t) {
        int m = s.length(), n = t.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        // initialize the dp value when t is an empty string, number of subsequence of an empty string should be 1
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i ++){
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        }
        for(int i = 1; i <= m; i ++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= n; j ++){
                //in both cases, the subsequence in String t should be ending with character t.charAt(j - 1)
                if(s.charAt(i - 1) == t.charAt(j - 1)){
                    // when two pointers pointing to same character
                    // if we take these two characters simultaneously, we should have dp[i-1][j-1] subsequences
                    // otherwise if we overlook current i (moving back for one step) and keeping the current j we have another dp[i -1][j]
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j];
                }else{
                    // when two pointers pointing to difference characters
                    //we cannot take these two characters but we still should make j ending with pointing to current position
                    // then we should move i backward
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
```
