## 221. Maximal Square

Given an `m x n` binary `matrix` filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, _find the largest square containing only_ `1`'s _and return its area_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** matrix = \[\["1","0","1","0","0"\],\["1","0","1","1","1"\],\["1","1","1","1","1"\],\["1","0","0","1","0"\]\]
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

![.](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/max2grid.jpg)

**Input:** matrix = \[\["0","1"\],\["1","0"\]\]
**Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** matrix = \[\["0"\]\]
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `matrix[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

class Solution:
    def maximalSquare(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if matrix is None or len(matrix) < 1:
            return 0

        rows = len(matrix)
        cols = len(matrix[0])

        dp = [[0]*(cols+1) for _ in range(rows+1)]
        max_side = 0

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if matrix[r][c] == '1':
                    dp[r+1][c+1] = min(dp[r][c], dp[r+1][c], dp[r][c+1]) + 1 # Be careful of the indexing since dp grid has additional row and column
                    max_side = max(max_side, dp[r+1][c+1])

        return max_side * max_side
```
