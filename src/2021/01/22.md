## 1657. [Determine if Two Strings Are Close](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/)

Two strings are considered **close** if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

- Operation 1: Swap any two **existing** characters.
  - For example, `abcde -> aecdb`
- Operation 2: Transform **every** occurrence of one **existing** character into another **existing** character, and do the same with the other character.
  - For example, `aacabb -> bbcbaa` (all `a`'s turn into `b`'s, and all `b`'s turn into `a`'s)

You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, return `true` *if* `word1` *and* `word2` *are **close**, and* `false` *otherwise.*

**Example 1:**

```s
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "abc" -> "acb"
Apply Operation 1: "acb" -> "bca"
```

**Example 2:**

```s
Input: word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"
Output: false
Explanation:It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any number of operations.
```

**Example 3:**

```s
Input: word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 3 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "cabbba" -> "caabbb"
Apply Operation 2: "caabbb" -> "baaccc"
Apply Operation 2: "baaccc" -> "abbccc"
```

**Example 4:**

```s
Input: word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "aabbss"
Output: false
Explanation:It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any amount of operations.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 105`
- `word1` and `word2` contain only lowercase English letters.

```go
func closeStrings(word1 string, word2 string) bool {
 if len(word1) != len(word2) {
  return false
 }
 freqCount1, freqCount2 := make([]int, 26), make([]int, 26)
 for _, c := range word1 {
  freqCount1[c-97]++
 }
 for _, c := range word2 {
  freqCount2[c-97]++
 }
 for i := 0; i < 26; i++ {
  if (freqCount1[i] == freqCount2[i]) ||
   (freqCount1[i] > 0 && freqCount2[i] > 0) {
   continue
  }
  return false
 }
 sort.Ints(freqCount1)
 sort.Ints(freqCount2)
 for i := 0; i < 26; i++ {
  if freqCount1[i] != freqCount2[i] {
   return false
  }
 }
 return true
}
```
