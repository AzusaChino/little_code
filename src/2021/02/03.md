## 141. Linked List Cycle

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` *if there is a cycle in the linked list*. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```s
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**Example 2:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

```s
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**Example 3:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

```s
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `pos` is `1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

```java
public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
    if(head==null) return false;
    ListNode walker = head;
    ListNode runner = head;
    while(runner.next!=null && runner.next.next!=null) {
        walker = walker.next;
        runner = runner.next.next;
        if(walker==runner) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```
