## 821. [Shortest Distance to a Character](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-to-a-character/)

Given a string `s` and a character `c` that occurs in `s`, return *an array of integers* `answer` *where* `answer.length == s.length` *and* `answer[i]` *is the **distance** from index* `i` *to the **closest** occurrence of character* `c` *in* `s`.

The **distance** between two indices `i` and `j` is `abs(i - j)`, where `abs` is the absolute value function.

**Example 1:**

```s
Input: s = "loveleetcode", c = "e"
Output: [3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0]
Explanation: The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 1 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(1 - 3) = 3.
For index 4, there is a tie between the 'e' at index 3 and the 'e' at index 5, but the distance is still the same: abs(4 - 3) == abs(4 - 5) = 1.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 8 is at index 6, so the distance is abs(8 - 6) = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```s
Input: s = "aaab", c = "b"
Output: [3,2,1,0]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s[i]` and `c` are lowercase English letters.
- It is guaranteed that `c` occurs at least once in `s`.

```c++
    vector<int> shortestToChar(string S, char C) {
        int n = S.size(), pos = -n;
        vector<int> res(n, n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (S[i] == C) pos = i;
            res[i] = i - pos;
        }
        for (int i = pos - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (S[i] == C)  pos = i;
            res[i] = min(res[i], pos - i);
        }
        return res;
    }
