## 11. Container With Most Water

Given `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an` , where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line `i` is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

```s
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```s
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```s
Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
```

**Example 4:**

```s
Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 104`

```py
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height):
        i, j = 0, len(height) - 1
        water = 0
        while i < j:
            water = max(water, (j - i) * min(height[i], height[j]))
            if height[i] < height[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        return water
```
