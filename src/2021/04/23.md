## 696. Count Binary Substrings

Give a string `s`, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

**Example 1:**

```plain
Input: "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.

Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring becauseall the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.

```

**Example 2:**

```plain
Input: "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.

```

**Note:**

- `s.length` will be between 1 and 50,000.
- `s` will only consist of "0" or "1" characters.

---

First, I count the number of 1 or 0 grouped consecutively.
For example "0110001111" will be [1, 2, 3, 4].

Second, for any possible substrings with 1 and 0 grouped consecutively, the number of valid substring will be the minimum number of 0 and 1.
For example "0001111", will be min(3, 4) = 3, ("01", "0011", "000111")

```java
    public int countBinarySubstrings(String s) {
        int cur = 1, pre = 0, res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i - 1)) cur++;
            else {
                res += Math.min(cur, pre);
                pre = cur;
                cur = 1;
            }
        }
        return res + Math.min(cur, pre);
    }
```
