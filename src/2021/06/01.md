## 695. Max Area of Island

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return *the maximum **area** of an island in* `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```s
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

**Example 2:**

```s
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

```py
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid):
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        def dfs(i, j):
            if 0 <= i < m and 0 <= j < n and grid[i][j]:
                grid[i][j] = 0
                return 1 + dfs(i - 1, j) + dfs(i, j + 1) + dfs(i + 1, j) + dfs(i, j - 1)
            return 0

        areas = [dfs(i, j) for i in range(m) for j in range(n) if grid[i][j]]
        return max(areas) if areas else 0
