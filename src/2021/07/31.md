## 42. [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**

![.](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)

**Input:** height = \[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1\]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array \[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1\]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** height = \[4,2,0,3,2,5\]
**Output:** 9

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `0 <= n <= 3 * 104`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 105`

---

```c
int trap(int* height, int n) {
    int level = 0, water = 0;
    while (n--) {
        int lower = *height < height[n] ? *height++ : height[n];
        if (lower > level) level = lower;
        water += level - lower;
    }
    return water;
}
```
