## 834. Sum of Distances in Tree

There is an undirected connected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` edges.

You are given the integer `n` and the array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the sum of the distances between the `ith` node in the tree and all other nodes.

**Example 1:**

![.](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-sumdist1.jpg)

**Input:** n = 6, edges = \[\[0,1\],\[0,2\],\[2,3\],\[2,4\],\[2,5\]\]
**Output:** \[8,12,6,10,10,10\]
**Explanation:** The tree is shown above.
We can see that dist(0,1) + dist(0,2) + dist(0,3) + dist(0,4) + dist(0,5)
equals 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.
Hence, answer\[0\] = 8, and so on.

**Example 2:**

![.](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-sumdist2.jpg)

**Input:** n = 1, edges = \[\]
**Output:** \[0\]

**Example 3:**

![.](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-sumdist3.jpg)

**Input:** n = 2, edges = \[\[1,0\]\]
**Output:** \[1,1\]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 3 * 104`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `ai != bi`
- The given input represents a valid tree.
