## 980. Unique Paths III

You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid` where `grid[i][j]` could be:

- `1` representing the starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
- `2` representing the ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
- `0` representing empty squares we can walk over.
- `-1` representing obstacles that we cannot walk over.

Return _the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once_.

**Example 1:**

![.](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/02/lc-unique1.jpg)

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,0,0,0\],\[0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,2,-1\]\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We have the following two paths:
1\. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
2\. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)

**Example 2:**

![.](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/02/lc-unique2.jpg)

**Input:** grid = \[\[1,0,0,0\],\[0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,0,2\]\]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** We have the following four paths:
1\. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)
2\. (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
3\. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
4\. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)

**Example 3:**

![.](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/02/lc-unique3-.jpg)

**Input:** grid = \[\[0,1\],\[2,0\]\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is no path that walks over every empty square exactly once.
Note that the starting and ending square can be anywhere in the grid.

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 20`
- `1 <= m * n <= 20`
- `-1 <= grid[i][j] <= 2`
- There is exactly one starting cell and one ending cell.
