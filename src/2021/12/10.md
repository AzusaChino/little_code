## 790. [Domino and Tromino Tiling](https://leetcode.com/problems/domino-and-tromino-tiling/)

You have two types of tiles: a `2 x 1` domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.

Given an integer n, return _the number of ways to tile an_ `2 x n` _board_. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The five different ways are show above.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`

```java
   public int numTilings(int N) {
        int a = 0, b = 1, c = 1, c2, mod = 1000000007;
        while (--N > 0) {
            c2 = (c * 2 % mod + a) % mod;
            a = b;
            b = c;
            c = c2;
        }
        return c;
    }
```
