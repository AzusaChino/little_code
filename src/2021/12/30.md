## 1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K

Given a positive integer `k`, you need to find the **length** of the **smallest** positive integer `n` such that `n` is divisible by `k`, and `n` only contains the digit `1`.

Return _the **length** of_ `n`. If there is no such `n`, return -1.

**Note:** `n` may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 1
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 2
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** k = 3
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= 105`

```java
class Solution {
    public int smallestRepunitDivByK(int K) {
        int remainder = 0;
        for (int length_N = 1; length_N <= K; length_N++) {
            remainder = (remainder * 10 + 1) % K;
            if (remainder == 0) {
                return length_N;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
