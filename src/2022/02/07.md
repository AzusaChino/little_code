## [389. Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
**Output:** "e"
**Explanation:** 'e' is the letter that was added.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "", t = "y"
**Output:** "y"

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

---

**Java Solution**

```java
public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
    int n = t.length();
    char c = t.charAt(n - 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        c ^= s.charAt(i);
        c ^= t.charAt(i);
    }
    return c;
}
```
