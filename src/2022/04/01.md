## [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with `O(1)` extra memory.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = \["h","e","l","l","o"\]
**Output:** \["o","l","l","e","h"\]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = \["H","a","n","n","a","h"\]
**Output:** \["h","a","n","n","a","H"\]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is a [printable ascii character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

**C++ Solution**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int i = 0, j = s.size() - 1;
        while(i < j){
            swap(s[i++], s[j--]);
        }
    }
};
```
