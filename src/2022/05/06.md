## [1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string-ii/)

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`, a `k` **duplicate removal** consists of choosing `k` adjacent and equal letters from `s` and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make `k` **duplicate removals** on `s` until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcd", k = 2
**Output:** "abcd"
**Explanation:** There's nothing to delete.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
**Output:** "aa"
**Explanation:** First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
**Output:** "ps"

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `2 <= k <= 104`
- `s` only contains lower case English letters.

**Java Solution**

```java
class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicates(String s, int k) {
        int i = 0, n = s.length(), count[] = new int[n];
        char[] stack = s.toCharArray();

        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++i, ++j) {
            stack[i] = stack[j];
            count[i] = i > 0 && stack[i - 1] == stack[j] ? count[i - 1] + 1 : 1;
            if (count[i] == k) {
                i -= k;
            }
        }

        return new String(stack, 0, i);
    }
}
```
