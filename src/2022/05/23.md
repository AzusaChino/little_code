## [474. Ones and Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/)

You are given an array of binary strings `strs` and two integers `m` and `n`.

Return _the size of the largest subset of `strs` such that there are **at most**_ `m` `0`_'s and_ `n` `1`_'s in the subset_.

A set `x` is a **subset** of a set `y` if all elements of `x` are also elements of `y`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = \["10","0001","111001","1","0"\], m = 5, n = 3
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.
Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}.
{"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** strs = \["10","0","1"\], m = 1, n = 1
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The largest subset is {"0", "1"}, so the answer is 2.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 600`
- `1 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists only of digits `'0'` and `'1'`.
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`

**C++ Solution**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxForm(vector<string>& strs, int m, int n) {
         vector<vector<int>> dp(m+1,vector<int>(n+1,0));
    
    for (auto &s: strs) {
        int ones = count(s.begin(), s.end(), '1');
        int zeros= s.size()-ones;
        for (int i=m; i>=zeros; i--) 
            for (int j=n; j>=ones; j--)
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-zeros][j-ones]+1);
    }
    return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```
